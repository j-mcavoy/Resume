  I am a full stack developer.
  I recently graduated with my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rowan University.
  During my time at Rowan, I've had extensive experience with
  Agile software development, Git, and developing websites using Django and React frameworks. I've
  developed these skills in not only my courses, but also in doing
  extra-curricular projects in my professional societies, my internships, and
  my job working as a paid consultant for the Rowan Apprentice Engineering Team
  (A-Team). The A-Team is a company started by the ECE and ME technologists,
  which hires a select team of students as consultants to extend the skills we
  learn in the classroom to design and build products for the university,
  researchers, and clients outside of the university.

  During my time working on the A-Team, I was given special access to the university's
  mechanical projects lab, PCB assembly center, ECE resource center, as well as
  advanced training on all of the ECE instrumentation and ME machinery.  I
  also gained product development skills by consulting with clients, creating
  WBS and scopes of work, and practising interative design process on a team of both electrical and mechanical
  I have a deep passion for learning and sharing skills with a team and I believe that the resources at
  {\company} will give me the opportunity to apply my expertise and continue to learn
  new skills.
