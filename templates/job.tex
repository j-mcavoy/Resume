\def\previousjobexperience{
    The A-Team is a company started by the university's ECE and ME technologists,
    which hires a select team of students as consultants to extend the skills we
    learn in the classroom to design and build products for the university,
    researchers, and clients outside of the university. During my
    years on the A-Team, I worked on projects ranging from developing full-stack web
    applications, consulting with researchers to design and build custom embedded
    systems for use in their experiments, and administering the company's Linux server.
