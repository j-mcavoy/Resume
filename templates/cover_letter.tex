%PARAGRAPH ONE: State the reason for the letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify the source from which you learned of the opening (i.e. career development center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).

I am applying for this full-time {\jobtitle} position at {\company}. I found
this job listing on the company's LinkedIn page.

%PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life.
I want to work at {\company} because this company's values
align with my own and I want to be a part of something that will
positively impact the world. I believe that {\company}'s mission to
{\companymission} is a great cause and I would like to be a part of it.

Based on this job description, I believe that I am a perfect fit for this
position.
%I have extensive experience with embedded systems and Linux as well as UX
%design, product development, and Agile workflows.
I recently graduated with my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from
Rowan University. During my time at Rowan, I've had hands-on experience with
embedded system design, Linux development, Yocto build tools,
and developing Qt interfaces. I've developed these skills in not only my
courses, but also in doing extra-curricular projects, at my internships, and
at my job working as a consultant on the Rowan Apprentice Engineering
Team (A-Team).

The A-Team is a company started by the university's ECE and ME technologists,
which hires a select team of students as consultants to extend the skills we
learn in the classroom to design and build products for the university,
researchers, and clients outside of the university. During my
years on the A-Team, I worked on projects ranging from developing full-stack web
applications, consulting with researchers to design and build custom embedded
systems for use in their experiments, and administering the company's Linux server.
I have a deep passion for connecting with customers and designing interfaces
that perfectly fit their needs and I believe that this position at {\company}
will give me the opportunity to apply my expertise and to share and learn
skills with my team.

%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials.

I am currently living in New Jersey and looking to relocate for this position. I
am available for phone and video interviews. You can reach me at my email,
\myemail, or by phone at \myphonenumber. I would like to thank you very much for
taking the time to consider my application and I hope you remain safe and well
during this pandemic.

\closing{Sincerely,}
